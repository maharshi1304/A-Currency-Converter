# A-Currency-Converter
A currency converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to convert values between different currencies. The application features a user-friendly interface with input fields for the amount and dropdown menus for selecting currencies. JavaScript handles the conversion calculations and fetches real-time exchange rates from an API. The converter dynamically updates the converted amount, providing a practical tool for users to understand currency values across different countries. This project enhances skills in API integration, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
